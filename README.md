# Summary of this project

This project is a complex backend project built with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, bcrypt, aws-sdk, razorpay, and many more. This project has all the features that a backend project should have. I am developing a complete E-Commerce website, with features including login, signup, product listings, product search, place order, order history, coupon creation, coupon application, and many more. 


Employing industry-standard practices like JWT for secure authentication, bcryptjs for password hashing, and a system of access and refresh tokens, this project adheres to best practices in backend development.
